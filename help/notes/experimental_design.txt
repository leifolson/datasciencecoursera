1. Start with a question!
2. Then look for data to answer the question
3. What out for confounding variables
    - need to pay attention to other variables that might influence results
    - remember, correlation is not causation
    - can use randomization and blocking
        - fix variables
        - or possibly randomize the variable
4. Predictions need a little more separation between distributions.
    - key quantities
        - Sensitivity: Pr(pos test | disease)
        - Specificity: Pr(neg test | no disease)
        - Pos. Predictive Val:  Pr(disease | pos test)
        - Neg. Predictive Val:  Pr(no disease | neg test)
        - Accuracy:     Pr(correct outcome)
5. Watch out for data dredging
6. Good experiments:
    - have replication
    - measure variability
    - generalize to problem you care about
    - are transparent

7. Prediction is not inference
