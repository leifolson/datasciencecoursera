Week 1
    - Make sure to have scripts for the data processing pipeline
    - These scripts should have a clear flow of how the raw data was processed into the tidy format
    - Create a code book that describes the variables, their types, etc.
    - Make sure to explain the experimental design as well
    - Downloading data
        - make sure to keep track of download dates
    - Extracting XML
        - <section>     // start tag
        - </section>    // end tag
        - <line-break/> // empty tag
        - use Library(XML)

    - Xpath...another format...look up reference
    
    - Reading JSON
        - library(jsonlite) 
        - can use toJSON() function to convert data to JSON
        - can use fromJSON() to get data frame from JSON

    - data.table  USE THESE!!  =)
        - generally faster than data.frame
        - written in C
        - its actually pretty cool
        - better for large objects
        - does not copy objects...just references
        - can set keys as well
        - makes merging much faster!
