-- just a few tips as I go through this course --

- can use read.fwf to read fixed width files and specify fields widths...pretty convenient!

- Subsetting / Sorting
    - can use logicals: X[(X$var1 <= 3 & X$var3 >= 0),]
    - which(): returns indices that meet a logical condition
    - order(): sorts rows by some specified variable
    - arrange(): also does sorting on a data frame, part of the plyr package

- Summarizing data
    - quantile() gives standard quantiles
    - can give args to get specific ones
    - table() is convenient for looking at categories
    - xtabs()  makes a cross-table
    - ftable() flattens out the result
    
- Create new variables
    - seq() creates a sequence of values...seems like linspace()
    - cut() quantizes a continuous variable
    - Hmisc package has cut2() that does this a bit easier
    - mutate() from plyr...mutates a data frame to add a new variable in place of another

- Reshaping Data
    - tidy data: one var to a col, one obs in each row, etc
    - melt(): tell what is an ID var and which are measure vars (makes tall/skinny)
    - dcast(data, rowvar ~ colvars): recast data set into a particular shape
    - ddply(): does split, apply, combine all in one step
    - plyr library is really nice to use
    
- Data Frames and dplyr     **** these are really nice to use ****
    - optimized version of plyr
    - select: return subset of cols
    - filter: extract subset of rows
    - arrange: reorder rows of data frame
    - rename: rename variables in data frame
    - mutate: add new vars/cols or xform existing vars
    - summarize: summary stats of data frame
    - groupby: split data frame on a particular categorical variable
    - %>%  pipeline operator...pipes output to input of something else
    - can also work with data tables, sql etc
    
- Merging data
    - merge(): provide two data frames and col names to merge on
    - defaults to merge on common var names
    - join(): does similar stuff....faster..but less features
    - join_all(): joins multiple data frames in a list
