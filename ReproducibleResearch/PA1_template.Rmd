This is an R Markdown document for Project 1 of the Coursera Reproducible Research course.  The purpose of this initial project is to gain experience with literate programming methods to produce a report that explores the activity monitoring data set obtained from the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip.

### Loading the data set

First, we load the data by reading directly from the csv file obtained from the link mentioned above.

```{r}
activityData <- read.csv("../data/activity.csv", header = TRUE)
```

At the present moment, the data will not be transformed or altered in any way.

### Mean steps per day

```{r, echo = TRUE}
aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activityData, mean)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
