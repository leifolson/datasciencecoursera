# some notes on the R profiler

- helps to determine code bottlenecks
- system.time() give back the time it takes for an expression to run

- Rprof(): starts profiler
- summaryRprof(): summarizes profiler output that is more readable
- do not use system.time() and Rprof() together
- not very useful if the program runs very quickly
- by.total normalizes by total run time
- by.self normalizes by total but subs out functions higher in the call stack
