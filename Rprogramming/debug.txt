invisible(x): makes the return value invisible...i.e., it doesn't get printed

traceback:  prints out function call stack
debug:      flags a function for debugging...lets me step through it
browser:    suspends the execution wherever it is called and puts function in debug mode
trace:      allows you to insert debugging code into a function at specific places
recover:    allows you to modify the error behavior so that you can look at the call stack
