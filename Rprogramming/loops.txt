lapply: loop over a list
sapply: same as lapply but try to simplify the result 
apply: operates over margins of array
tapply: applies over a table
mapply: multivariate version of lapply

split: can be useful in conjunction with apply functions


can pass in other args for the functions I put in lapply!

myth: apply is faster than a for loop
these days this is no longer true

if you want to compute sums/means of a rows/cols in a matrix use
rowSums / rowMeans
colSums / colMeans

instead of apply.  these have been optimzied for their operation

when working with a 3D array, can pass in c(1,2) to collapse the third dimension
